This project is just a backend for a future project at [@SanDiegoCodeSchool](https://github.com/SanDiegoCodeSchool)

A working example of the project can be found [here as a Now deploy](https://node101-vstda-api.zarkal.now.sh/), although there isn't much you can do with it as is.

The server manipulates an array of objects in response to GET, POST, and DELETE requests to `/api/ToDoItems/`, and listens on port 8484.

You can clone this project from github with `git clone "git@github.com:Z4rkal/VSTDA-API.git"`. If you have NodeJS and npm you can run `npm install` in the project directory to download the dependencies, and then `npm start` to launch the server.
